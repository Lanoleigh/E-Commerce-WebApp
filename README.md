# E-Commerce-WebApp
This is an E-Commerce WebApp built utilizing ASP.Net Core Web App Model with .NET 8. Please refer to README file for a detailed description.

This Web Application was initally made for local usage with a local database connected to it.
Later in developement I deployed the web app and SQL database using Azure Web App service and the Azure SQL database.
The Web app allows for Writing to the database and reading from the database. 
I made my own authorization and authentication functionality.
I utilized cookies to store user identity throughout the application.
I am aware that this application is not perfect with major flaws such as the connection string being in the page model for the relevant pages and not in the json file and connecting it in the Program.cs file and using dependency injection in the Page Model or Controller. 
I want to learn from this and will do so with my next project.
This is simply a "benchmark" project. It will only improve from here.
I plan on imporving, learning and making more user-friendly applications.
